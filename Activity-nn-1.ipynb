    "I have written a basic LSH implementation in Python, with instantiations for the cosine similarity, Hamming distance, and the Jaccard coefficient LSH families. The code is written in OOP style and can be easily extended to other LSH families. Take a look at lsh.py for the details. In this demo, we will be using the cosine similarity version of the LSH data structure, *clsh*."
